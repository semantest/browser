#+TITLE: Semantest Browser - Development Journal
#+AUTHOR: Semantest Team
#+DATE: [2024-01-07]

* Overview

This repository contains the core browser automation framework for Semantest. It provides the foundation for semantic web automation, moving beyond fragile CSS selectors to intelligent, contract-driven automation.

* Repository History

** Monorepo Separation (2024-01-07)

This repository was extracted from the original chatgpt-buddy monorepo as part of Phase 8A of the Semantest platform evolution. The separation preserves the complete git history of the web-buddy/packages/core directory.

*** Key Changes
- Extracted from =web-buddy/packages/core/= directory in the monorepo
- Now published as =@semantest/browser= on npm
- Repository URL: https://github.com/semantest/browser
- Part of the semantest organization
- Core dependency for all Semantest implementations

*** Post-Separation Setup Required
1. Update package.json dependencies from workspace references to npm packages
2. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow
3. Configure npm publishing with NPM_TOKEN secret
4. Update README with proper documentation

** Package Configuration Updates (2025-01-07)

As part of the post-monorepo-separation tasks, the package.json was updated to reflect the new organizational structure:

*** Changes Made
- Updated package name to =@semantest/browser= (using the semantest npm organization)
- Updated repository URLs to point to =https://github.com/semantest/browser=
- Updated bugs URL to =https://github.com/semantest/browser/issues=
- Updated homepage to =https://github.com/semantest/browser=
- All dependencies already use npm packages (no workspace references to update)
- Added proper exports configuration for ESM/CJS compatibility
- Retained author as original developer

*** Rationale
These changes complete the transition from the monorepo structure to independent repositories under the semantest GitHub organization. The browser package serves as the core foundation for all Semantest implementations and is now ready for independent versioning and npm publishing.

** Original Development

Originally developed as web-buddy-core, this package evolved from simple browser automation to a sophisticated semantic automation framework. Key milestones include:

- Initial WebSocket communication with browser extensions

*** Semantic Selectors
- Natural language element selection
- Context-aware element finding
- Fallback strategies
- Performance optimization

*** Contract System
- Element contracts definition
- Contract validation
- Version management
- Breaking change detection

*** Action Engine
- High-level action abstractions
- Retry logic and error handling
- Action composition
- Parallel execution support

** Key Features
- Framework-agnostic design
- TypeScript-first with full type safety
- Extensible plugin system
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance monitoring

* Future Roadmap

- AI-powered self-healing selectors
- Visual regression testing integration
- Multi-tab orchestration
- Cloud browser support
- WebDriver BiDi protocol support

* Phase 9: Security Architecture Integration (2025-07-14 to 2025-07-15)

** Overview
Phase 9 enhanced the browser framework with security-first design principles, integrating with the comprehensive security architecture implemented across the Semantest ecosystem.

** Security Integration Points
*** Secure Communication Layer
- WebSocket encryption with TLS 1.3
- Message authentication and integrity checks
- Rate limiting on message handling
- Origin validation for all connections

*** Authentication Integration
- JWT token propagation support
- Bearer token handling in headers
- Token refresh mechanism integration
- Correlation ID tracking for requests

*** Security Event Reporting
- Integration with audit logging system
- Security event emission for monitoring
- Anomaly detection data collection
- Performance metrics with security context

** Architectural Enhancements
*** Defense-in-Depth Implementation
- Multiple validation layers for actions
- Input sanitization at framework level
- Output encoding for XSS prevention
- Content Security Policy support

*** Zero-Trust Principles
- Per-request authentication validation
- Least privilege action execution
- Explicit permission model
- Continuous verification

** Security Best Practices
*** Code Security
- No secret storage in browser code
- Environment-based configuration
- Secure defaults for all options
- Cryptographic nonce generation

*** Data Protection
- Sensitive data masking in logs
- Encrypted storage for credentials
- Secure cleanup of temporary data
- Memory protection for secrets

** Integration with Server Security
*** JWT Token Flow
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
// Browser framework JWT integration
interface SecureClientConfig {
  serverUrl: string;
  getAuthToken: () => Promise<string>;
  onAuthError: (error: AuthError) => void;
  enableIPBinding?: boolean;
  enableDeviceFingerprint?: boolean;
}

// Automatic token refresh
class SecureBrowserClient extends BrowserClient {
  private async ensureAuthenticated(): Promise<void> {
    const token = await this.config.getAuthToken();
    this.connection.setAuthHeader(`Bearer ${token}`);
  }
}
#+END_SRC

*** Security Event Integration
